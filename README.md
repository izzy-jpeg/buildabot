# Welcome to Buildabot!
## What is Buildabot?
Buildabot is a free class hosted by me, Izaan Ibrahim, designed to teach kids the introductory skills and knowledge of how to build and program their own robots. Over the course of 5 days of classes, they will build their own robot and develop programs to make it perform the functions they want, and they'll go home with the very robot they built.
